I apply image processing, computer vision and machine learning to interesting
problems. This is my personal blog, where I may write anything I happen to be
interested in.

I enjoy writing code in high-level languages such as Python and MATLAB, 
but I'm also familiar with C and C++.

The design of this page is based on the nice
[Daryl](https://github.com/andrewcodes/daryl) theme for
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
